### `Error: Asking for confirmation: EOF`

This probably means you have piped configuration into kapp and did not specify `--yes` (`-y`) flag to continue. It's necessary because kapp can no longer ask for confirmation via stdin. Feel free to re-run the command with `--diff-changes` (`-c`) to make sure pending changes are correct.
